# OP-LAB-PROJECT
Mini OS Simulator (C++)

This project is a mini operating system simulator written in C++ that demonstrates core OS concepts such as process scheduling, process states, multithreading, synchronization, and deadlock avoidance using the Banker’s Algorithm.

The simulator uses producer–consumer threads to generate and schedule processes, maintains ready and blocked queues, and simulates CPU execution with resource allocation and release. Processes can also be added manually, and the system state (queues and available resources) can be viewed at runtime.

Key Features

Multithreading with std::thread

Process Control Block (PCB) simulation

Ready and Blocked queues

Banker’s Algorithm for safe resource allocation

Producer–Consumer synchronization using mutex and condition variables

Interactive menu-driven interface

This project is intended for operating systems learning and demonstration purposes.
